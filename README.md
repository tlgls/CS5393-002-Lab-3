## Binary Search Tree (BST)
### Objectives:
The objective of the program is to develop a Binary Search Tree (BST) that
efficiently performs key operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching
nodes. The program builds the BST using a provided dataset in the main class,
then performs an in-order traversal to display the sorted sequence of elements.
It’ll also demonstrate the search functionality by locating specific nodes,
including both integer and decimal values (as shown in the main class). It will
also handle node deletions such as (values 50 and 100), followed by another in-
order traversal to show the updated structure of the tree.

## Hashtable
### Objectives:
The objective of the program is to implement a hash table that supports key
insertion, deletion, and searching, while handling collisions using the separate
chaining method. A custom hash function will map keys into buckets, and the
program will display the hash table. It will search for phone numbers associated
with “Liam” and delete entries for “Isabella Anderson,” updating the hash table
accordingly. Additionally, the program will search for “Shaibal Chakrabarty” and
“Lucas Li,” then insert new entries for both names, displaying the final hash table
to reflect the changes.
